# Thoughts About The Code:

## What makes it amazing code or what makes it ok code or what makes it terriable code:

The code seems overall OK, and there are both pros and cons in the codebase I have tried to refactor in this repository:

### Pros

1. The project is much complex, and the author has correctly separated the Controller from Model.
2. The existence of test cases is evident that the author has paid attention to details, which is good.
3. The code is organized into functions with clear responsibilities, such as `getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId`, `sendNotificationTranslator`, `sendSMSNotificationToTranslator`, etc.
4. Most variable names like `$mailer`, `$job`, `$data`, and `$user` are descriptive and convey their purpose.
5. Some comments on functions and code are used to explain the purpose of the code or specific sections, enhancing code readability.
6. Logging is implemented using Laravel's logging system, providing visibility into the application's behavior during runtime.
7. Constants are used for values like `'emails.session-ended'`, which improves maintainability and readability.
8. Environmental variables are configured safely based on Laravel standards.
9. While not fully implemented, there is potential for dependency injection in the code.
10. Laravel helpers like `TeHelper::getUsermeta` and `TeHelper::convertJobIdsInObjs` are used, providing utility functions.

### What makes it terrible code

1. There are some hardcoding values without clear context or explanation, which could make the code less maintainable. Consider using constants or enumerations.
2. The code uses direct database queries without utilizing Laravel's Eloquent ORM or Query Builder, making it less expressive and harder to maintain. The database is not correctly configured with the Laravel Eloquent ORM.
3. Most items are enclosed in nested loops, which could cause issues with a large number of records.
4. The code lacks proper exception handling, especially for database queries and API requests. Adding try-catch blocks or using Laravel's exception handling features would enhance robustness.
5. Some conditions, especially nested conditions, are complex and might benefit from refactoring for better readability.
6. While some comments are present, they could be more informative and cover a broader range of the codebase.
7. The cURL requests for push notifications are implemented directly. Consider using Laravel's HTTP client or a dedicated package for sending HTTP requests.
8. There is a mix of naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case) for function and variable names. Consistency in naming can improve code readability.
9. Some variables are declared but not used, which might indicate unnecessary code.
10. The code could be better organized if complex functions were transversed into multiple meaningful functions.
11. Each entity should be converted into proper models and controller models so that it is meaningful. Instead of using direct DB access, it could be better to query the Eloquent Laravel models to make the code more maintainable and readable.
12. The code could be divided and structured better. It should not be in the same file; currently, all code is in one Repository (BookingRepository). Proper models and methods split into detailed explaining naming conventions could make the code more readable and reliable.
13. The code does not follow standard formatting and indentation. While it has complex conditions, they could be modified as refactored.
